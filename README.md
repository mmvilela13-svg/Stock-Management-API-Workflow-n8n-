# Stock-Management-API-Workflow-n8n-
This workflow is a complete REST API built in n8n to manage a car dealership stock for a web application.  It uses Google Sheets as the backend database for simplicity in this proof-of-concept version. The workflow supports standard CRUD operations for inventory management and allows the web app to interact with the stock seamlessly.
